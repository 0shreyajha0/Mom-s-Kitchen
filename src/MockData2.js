        "Gnocchi works really well with Chianti, Verdicchio, and Trebbiano. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Santa Margherita Chianti Classico Riserva with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.",

The tannic, oak-aged flavors are bright and round, with a dry, warm, earthy finish. Recommended for barbecued meat, like sliced Chianina steak, or with game, such as pheasant stuffed with truffles. It is also excellent with mature cheese.",

    instructions:
      "<ol><li>Put the cold precooked polenta in a mixer and blend it with the egg until creamy.</li><li>Add the buckwheat flour. You will need more or less 1/3 of a cup, but a lot depends on how sticky your polenta. Add enough flour to get a soft dough that doesn't stick to your hand.</li><li>Form the gnocchi on a floured surface by rolling out the dough in long logs, more or less as thick as a thumb and then cut them in gnocchi. If you want the gnocchi to look super nice, roll them on a fork to give them the characteristic stripes (I never do). Place the gnocchi in the fridge while you prepare the sauce.</li><li>Cut the savoy cabbage in stripes, wash it and stew it with a bit of water until wilted. Drain it and sautee it with 1 spoon butter and salt until cooked.</li><li>Prepare the cheese by dicing it and the rest of the butter by melting it with the sage and the garlic.</li><li>Cook the gnocchi in salted boiling water in batches. Throw 10-20 gnocchi in the pot of boiling water and fish them out once they start floating. Drain them and add them to a bowl. Dress with cheese, cabbage and butter and keep layering the ingredients in the bowl until you run out.</li><li>Do not mix the gnocchi in the bowl, as they are rather soft and would break. If the cheese didn't melt much, you can microwave the bowl for a couple of minutes.</li><li>Serve piping hot.</li></ol>",
